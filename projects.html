<h2>Wireless Recognition and Information Syncing Technology</h2>
In an independent design project, with a team of 5 student engineers, we created a wearable device with a social purpose. The goal of W.R.I.S.T. was to enhance the time and quality of social and professional interactions. In order to achieve this, we created a wearable device that will make keeping connections easier than ever. The design consisted of creating a wearable device with a gyroscope and accelerometer for motion tracking, NFC for peer to peer device communication, and Bluetooth for mobile device communication.
